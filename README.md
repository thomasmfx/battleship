# Battleship

## Overview

This project is a web implementation of the good old battleship game. The user can cycle through possible positions that the ships can be placed in its board, and then start a game against a bot, that ends once either the player's or bot's ships are all sunk. The project was built with a modular strucure and include unit tests to ensure the game's functionality.
